# 8x8-Arduino-Matrix-
A PCB design of an 8x8 LED matrix for an Arduino slap-on interface + Code.
The PCB desgined was manufactured in China, and the components were soldered by me. Kicad was used to design the board to specifically 
fit the 8x8 LED matrix on an arduino MEGA. 
The code for the program is a simple game designed to display and test functionality of the circuit board.
The game: Using the push-buttons on the interface, dodge all falling blocks
